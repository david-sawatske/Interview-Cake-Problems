# Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.
#
# Love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." Also, each side
# is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

# Rectanglgles are defined as hashes
# my_rectangle = {
#
#   # coordinates of bottom-left corner
#   'left_x' => 1,
#   'bottom_y' => 5,
#
#   # width and height
#   'width' => 10,
#   'height' => 4,
